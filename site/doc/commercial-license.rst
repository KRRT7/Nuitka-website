   Part of Nuitka commercial.

   Commercial grade license of Nuitka. No distribution to outside of the
   buyer is allowed, the file must be kept secret. Usage is limited to
   Nuitka. Changed versions, or versions of changes sent to the

   up later.

   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software

   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

Intended consequences are

#. You do not get to sue me, just like with Nuitka itself.

#. You have to keep Nuitka commercial secret, but you get its source
   code so you can check that there is no malice.

#. If you modify Nuitka commercial and send it to me, you automatically
   relicense to Apache license, such that I effectively can use it in
   any way, including keeping it in Nuitka commercial, and also making
   it part of Nuitka standard (the Free Software) edition.
