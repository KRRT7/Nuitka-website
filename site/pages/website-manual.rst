Recommended Way
===============

Learn how to contribute to the **Nuitka** website efficiently with
**Visual Studio Code** and **Dev containers**. You will be amazed at how
easy it is to contribute to changes to the **Nuitka** website in this
way. A manual way for advanced users is described below in the `Manual
way`_ section.

Before You Start
----------------

#. Download and install **Docker** using the `Docker website
   <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>`_.

#. Download and install **Git** on your computer. To do that, select one
   of the following ways:

      -  For Mac: download **Xcode** using `App Store
         <https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/xcode/id497799835?l=uk&mt=12>`_.

      -  For Windows: go to the `Git for Windows
         <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_ page, and then in the
         page, select **Click here to download**. Then, install **Git**
         by accepting the default settings.

      -  For Linux: go to the `Git for Linux
         <https://git-scm.com/download/linux>`_ page, and then select
         the needed option based on your Linux distribution.

#. Sign up on `GitHub <https://github.com>`__. An account on **GitHub**
   is free and allows you to submit your changes to the **Nuitka**
   website repository. For more, see the `Sign-up instructions
   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github>`_.

#. Download and install **Visual Studio Code**. Go to the `Visual Studio
   Code website <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_, and then select the
   **Download** button, which is universal for all the operating
   systems.

Getting Started
---------------

#. Open **Visual Studio Code**, and then open a terminal by selecting
   **Ctrl** + **`** or **Cmd** + **`** on Mac.

#. On the terminal, enter the following commands:

   .. code:: bash

      git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

   .. note::

      Replace **Your Name** with your actual name and
      **your.email@example.com** with your email address.

#. Go to `Nuitka GitHub
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka-website.git>`_, and then, in the
   upper-right corner, select **Fork**.

      .. image:: ../../images/select-fork.png
         :alt: The screenshot of the GitHub page with the Fork button highlighted.
         :width: 600px

#. After you create the fork, go to your GitHub account and select your
   forked repository that called **Your-name/Nuitka-website**.

#. Select **Code** (1), then copy the **web URL** (2).
      .. image:: ../../images/select-code-and-copy.png
         :alt: The screenshot of the GitHub page with the Code button highlighted.
         :width: 600px

#. Open **Visual Studio Code**, and then, on the **Welcome** page,
   select **Clone Git Repository**.

      .. image:: ../../images/select-clone-git-repo.png
         :alt: The screenshot of the Visual Studio Code Welcome page with the Clone Git Repository feature highlighted.
         :width: 600px

   .. note::

      Cloning is a term used in version control, meaning you create a
      local copy of a central repository, and git is the tool used for
      it. Do not worry much about those things, **Visual Studio Code**
      hides it away from you, essentially.

#. In the **Provide repository URL** box (1), paste the link you pasted
   in the **step 6**, and then select **Clone from URL** (2).

      .. image:: ../../images/paste-the-link-to-clone-repo.png
         :alt: Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code "Welcome page" with the link pasted.
         :width: 600px

#. Confirm a target folder, and create a folder inside of it named
   **Nuitka-website.git**.

#. In the **Would you like to open the cloned repository** window,
   select **Open**.

#. In the **Do you trust the authors** window, select **Yes, I trust the
   authors**.

#. Once you do that, you will see the **Folder contains a Dev Container
   configuration file** window. Select **Reopen in Container**.

   The Dev Container will start and download a small container image of
   **Ubuntu**, which is a popular **Linux** variant. Then, it will run a
   few commands to customize the image and build and render the website
   pages.

   .. important::

      Do not worry if you are unfamiliar with **Linux**. You won't have
      to notice or do anything different at all. The container image is
      automated, and **Visual Studio Code** will deal with git for you.

   After some time, it will prompt you to open a ``localhost`` port in
   your standard browser, and you can use it to navigate the website.

Make and Save Your Changes
--------------------------

#. **Make your change**

   Pick the page you want to edit, for example, ``doc/index.rst``,
   select **Ctrl** + **S** (or **Cmd** + **S** for Mac) to save changes
   and rebuild the website. When the rebuild is over, you can preview
   your changes in your browser and see your changed local copy of the
   website. You can also find the URL for the local copy of the Nuitka
   website in the **Terminal** tab and click on it.

   Some changes, such as changes to the CSS theme or JavaScript, may
   require a relaunch. Then, use the **Dev Container: Rebuild
   container** command. It will take a moment to refresh the project and
   implement your changes fully. For usual edits of **.rst** pages, you
   don't need to relaunch or rebuild the container.

#. **Stage and Commit Your Change**

   When you're ready to suggest your changes to the original **Nuitka
   website**, you need to stage your changes. In the **Visual Studio
   Code**, find the **Source Control** tab, where you will see your
   changes. Select **+** next to each change you want to stage. Then, in
   the **Message** box, enter the description of the changes you staged.
   Then, select the **Commit** button. For more details, refer to the
   `Commit guidelines
   <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_commit>`_.

#. **Push Your Changes**

   In the **Source Control** tab, select |three-dots|, and then select
   **Push**.

      .. |three-dots| image:: ../../images/select-three-dots.png
         :alt: The screenshot of the three dots button.
         :width: 30px

#. **Create a Pull Request**

   By selecting the command **GitHub Pull Requests: Create Pull
   Request**, Visual Studio Code will guide you through the process of
   making a PR out of your pull request.

#. **Communicate About Your Pull Request**

   Once your pull request is submitted, you'll receive a URL to track
   its progress. If we request changes during the review process, GitHub
   notifies you, and you can make the necessary updates directly within
   the project. After making the changes, you'll either update the pull
   request or be informed when it's merged.

Manual Way
==========

This section described how to build the **Nuitka** website manually.
Enhancements of all kinds are welcome. You will need Python 3.10 and
``pipenv`` to build it.

.. code:: bash

   # Creates a virtualenv with all that is needed to develop the
   # site.
   python3 -m pip install -U invoke
   python3 -m invoke virtualenv

   # Now lets build the site, to see if it's all correct.
   python3 -m invoke site

   # Optionally build the localized sites (currently not working)
   # python3 -m invoke intl -l zh_CN
   # python3 -m invoke intl -l de_DE
   ...

   # post-processing, e.g. adds language switcher, compact
   # JS/CSS, adapts external links, and more.
   python3 -m invoke post-process

   # Start local web server with the site, and do automatic
   # rebuilds. Localization are rebuilt if they were previously
   # built.
   python3 -m invoke serve

   # Browse it (Linux)
   xdg-open http://localhost:8080
   # Browse it (Windows)
   explorer http://localhost:8080

*************
 How We Work
*************

In this section, we provide insights into our workflow and the tools we
use to streamline our collaboration on the **Nuitka website**.

Sphinx
======

The **Nuitka website** is powered by **Sphinx** â€” a documentation
generation tool widely used in the software development community. We
use **Sphinx** to render user-friendly web pages for Nuitka, which you
are looking at. To get more details about Sphinx, see `Sphinx
documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`__.

reStructured Text (reST)
========================

**Sphinx** uses **reStructured text (reST)** as its markup language,
which is similar to **Markdown** but more powerful. You will need
**reST** to edit the website pages. Check out the syntax in the `Sphinx
documentation
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__.

Sphinx Theme
============

We are using the customization of the `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme
<https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`__. The
current configuration in ``shared_conf.py`` file is pretty basic. We
might want to explore and document our choices for some of these
options.

Sphinx Extension: Grids
=======================

We use `Grids
<https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grids.html>`_, a
component of the **Sphinx Design** extension to build the layout of our
website pages.

Sphinx Extension: ABlog
=======================

We are using a **Sphinx** extension called **ABlog** to create the RSS
feeds and pages of the **Nuitka blog**. To read about **ABlog**
configuration options, see the `ABlog documentation
<https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/ablog-configuration-options.html>`_.

Document Formatting
===================

To format the current document, in **Visual Studio Code**, select the
task ``autoformat current file`` which will make automatic changes to
the file for consistent header formatting, etc.

All PRs should have their changed files formatted that way. We do not
yet have a commit hook that does it.

Image Optimization
==================

We optimize all the images we insert in the website to enhance the
website performance and achieve better search engine rankings. To
optimize images, run the task ``autoformat PNG images`` or ``autoformat
JPEG images`` or ``autoformat current file`` in Visual Code, the latter
with the image being open.

Otherwise, if you are not in the Dev Container, open a new terminal in
the and paste the following code snippet.

.. code:: bash

   # Optimize PNG files like this, usually already done unless you
   # added new ones.
   sudo apt-get install optipng
   find . -iname *.png -a -type f -exec optipng -o7 -zm1-9 {} \;

   # Optimize JPEG files like this, usually already done unless you
   # added new ones.
   sudo apt-get install jpegoptim
   find . -iname *.jpg -a -type f -exec jpegoptim {} \;

Color Palette
=============

If you create any visuals for **Nuitka**, such as presentation slides,
diagrams, or even screenshots, keep in mind the following brand colors:

Primary colors:
   -  Blue #599DD2
   -  Yellow #FFD43B
   -  Grey #CCCCCC

Secondary colors:
   -  Dark Blue #2A3990
   -  Green #00916E

Writing Style Guide
===================

When writing any text on the **Nuitka** website, especially step-by-step
guidelines, strive to follow the `Microsoft Style Guide
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/>`_.
